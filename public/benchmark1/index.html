    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This document describes a game called “Race Against COVID”, which is designed to be a top-down roguelike dungeon-crawler. 
        This game helps raise awareness for the ever-increasing dangers caused by the novel coronavirus in an entertaining form factor. 
        This game utilizes sprite-based animation, tiled backgrounds, collision detection, physics, AI, efficient memory management,
         render threading, original audio and artwork, and other 2D game techniques. </p>



    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>
        “Race Against COVID” will be made using Phaser 3, a 2D game framework for developing HTML5 games on desktop. 
        It utilizes WebGL as its underlying rendering system. Music and audio effects are handled through Phaser. 
        Sprite design and animations are created through Aesprite.
    </p>
 
    <h2>Back Story</h2>
    <p>
        It’s 2020, and the world has been infected with the deadly COVID-19. With no apparent cure, panic consumes everybody as stores, 
        schools, businesses are being closed down due to this virus. Scientists have been hard at work developing a countermeasure 
        against this virus, an experimental pill dubbed RX-2020. The world’s hopes are lying on RX-2020’s shoulders.
    </p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        RX-2020’s goal is to navigate through the human body to arrive at the stomach. It is equipped with a medi-gun that 
        shoots out medication to destroy the viruses on his way to the stomach. As the body of the person who took RX-2020 is 
        deteriorating fast, RX-2020 only has a short amount of time to make it to their stomach. <br />

        If RX-2020 doesn’t make it in time, the body will succumb to the virus. On its way to the stomach, RX-2020 has to be 
        careful not to expend too much of its life force on clearing the path to the stomach, or else it won’t be effective enough 
        to save the patient. 
    </p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
        The style of the game will be a mix of a top-down dungeon crawler and bullet hell. The main goal of is to get RX-2020 to
        the stomach in time to save the patient. Along the way, RX-2020 will encounter the coronavirus, which must be cleared 
        from every room RX-2020 arrives in before it can continue on its way to the stomach.
        <ul>
            <li>RX-2020 will be able to shoot “medicine”, at the expense of its own life force,
                 using that to purge the viruses that stand between itself and the stomach.</li>
            <li>Every section of the body RX-2020 gets into must be cleared before it can continue on its journey to the stomach.</li>
            <li>If RX-2020 takes too long (timer runs out) the patient will die, and the level will fail.</li>
            <li>RX-2020 will encounter a variety of coronavirus types. These types will include basic viruses, viruses that can divide,
                 viruses that can attack from afar, quicker viruses, and viruses that can slow it.</li>
            <li>The more enemies RX-2020 kills, the more ‘points’ it will gain, allowing it to spend
                 it on upgrades to help it become more effective in curing the patients.</li>
            <li>RX-2020 will be able to find vitamin C supplements throughout the body to bolster its 
                ‘health’ (heal itself) and effectiveness.</li>
        </ul>
